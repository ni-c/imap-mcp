 * primitive if any layer ever stopped quoting, so they are refused outright —
 * along with the rest of the C0/C1 range, which the CR/LF/NUL check used to
 * leave through. A bare CR was the interesting one: `list_mailboxes` hands the
 * path back for the model to quote into the next call, and the confirmation
 * dialog a person reads before losing messages is line-oriented, so a name
 * carrying control characters is a name that does not read the way it looks.
 *
 * The `%` and `*` wildcards are refused too: they belong to LIST patterns, and
 * a "delete the mailbox `*`" that quietly matched everything is not a mistake
 * worth being one layer away from.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* refused: zero-width and directional-override characters.
 * A folder someone else created may genuinely have them in its name, and a
 * parameter that rejected them would leave that folder unreadable and
 * undeletable through this server. They are handled where they can be handled
 * honestly — `display_name` in the listing, and the escape form in the dialog.
