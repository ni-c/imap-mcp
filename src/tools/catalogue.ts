/**
 * The tools this server can register, declared rather than discovered.
 *
 * Declared, because the tool filter has to answer "is this a name you have?"
 * *before* anything is registered — and in read-only mode the write tools are
 * never registered at all. Deriving the catalogue from what actually reached
 * `registerTool` would make `IMAP_ALLOW_TOOLS=delete_messages` report "unknown
 * tool" under `IMAP_READ_ONLY=true`, which is the one answer that is wrong.
 *
 * This is also the full tool surface, hard-coded on purpose: a tool that appears
 * or disappears by accident is a change to the server's contract and has to be a
 * deliberate edit here. `test/tool-filter.test.ts` asserts that these lists and
 * the tools the server really registers are the same set.
 *
 * Note this covers *tools* only. This server also registers attachment
 * resources (`src/resources.ts`), and the filter does not touch those.

/**
 * Registered always — but "read" here means "registered under the read-only

 *
 * Two of them do write, and an operator who reads `IMAP_READ_ONLY=true` as

 * issues a STORE to set the seen keyword, which is how it can answer "anything
 * new?" at all — that is the deliberate trade, and `dry_run` previews it
 * without marking. `get_attachments` creates files when `IMAP_DOWNLOAD_DIR` is
 * set. Neither carries `readOnlyHint: true`; the other four do.
