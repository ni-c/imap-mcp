 * Types only, and that is a constraint rather than a preference. The worker is
 * spawned from its own source file — `worker.ts` under vitest, `worker.js` from
 * `dist/` — so everything it reaches is loaded by Node directly, and Node's type
 * stripping does not rewrite a `./x.js` specifier to the `./x.ts` that exists
 * next to it. A type-only import is erased before that can matter. A value
 * exported from here would not be, and would break `npm test` while leaving the
 * build green.
